So I happened to read a post about trade in the suggestions section and it got me thinking, you're the government, why would you personally build trade ships and then direct them? You wouldn't, but corporations would.

So my idea for a mod is one that add's corporations to the game along with supportive gameplay to add new gameplay and also change the way we gain resources to be a bit more realistic and more importantly more interesting.

#companies

+ Can only have one nationalised of each type
+ A type is either one product or one resource
+ Each company can deal with only one thing, a product type or a resource type
+ Each company is either a planet based or space based
+Product type companies contribute with research bonuses towards a research  type (related to the product type they sell) based on how much they are taxed (more tax, less research)
+ Resource type companies contribute a resource  (food, mineral, energy)
+ Each company can be charted or of their own accord run limited number of stations (nationalised can run more but not by much)

#corporations window section (each bullet point is a tab):
+ See all corporations, filter them by product, select nationalised corps only and even create new nationalised corps that deal with a product and also edit nationalised corps
+ See a listing of all taxes on products and separately on border tariffs both in and out and the ability to create a new border tariff and edit tax values and border tariffs
+See all the contributions made by the corporations (energy, minerals, food, research)
+ See all the lobbying done buy corporations for tax reductions on produc/border tariffs in return for influence gain

#space gameplay:
+ Trade fleets fly about from planet to planet
+Trade ships can be escorted by private war ships
+ Trade ships can be destroyed (pirates,war)
+ Trade foreign trade ships destroyed (pirates, war) will cause problems with that civ visa versa
+ In the outliner you should be able to see a listing of all trade fleets
+ Pirate dens will spawn you will be requested to deal with it
+ Can build defense fleet stations that will spawn - based on funding - defense fleets using your ship designs whose main purpose is to take protect trade routes
+ In the outliner you should be able to see a listing of all defense fleets
+ You can charter companies to mine resources or research on your behalf instead building a station yourself, for reduced maintenance cost but for reduced resources
+ Can only charter a company if there is a company available with a slot to do so
+ Private companies can on there own over time start mining/research, you don't pay maintenance on them but you get far less resources in return compared to chartered mining
+ Can still build stations as normal
Stations will be named in some way according to the owning company (if applicable)

#planet gameplay:
+ Build, maintain and upgrade buildings as normal
Charter companies to do the above for you for no maintainence but reduced returns
+ Build factories and rent to a company for reduced building maintenance and get research contribution multiplier (5x maybe?) for there product (so it speeds up a research type even more)
+ Company can only rent one factory at a time

And also events based around corporations as well.
